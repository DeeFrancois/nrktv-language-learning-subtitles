# NRKTV Language Learning Subtitles
[Available here on the Chrome Extension Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nrk-tv-language-learning/lmjfcijpnghdkpnoakgljodpjnimbakp?hl=en)

Enables Dual Subtitles for NRK TV by utilizing the browser's built-in auto-translation feature.

### Motivation:

I've been learning Norwegian and thought it would be helpful if NRK TV had a dual subtitle feature. Since they don't, and it's very unlikely that they ever will, I just learned to do it myself.

### How to Use:

Once installed, all you have to do is make sure your browser's auto-translation feature is activated. You can set it to Always Translate Norwegian by clicking those 3 dots. 

<sup><sup> I don't like to use the "Always Translate" mode though because you get less of that immersion factor when browsing the main site</sup></sup>

### Current Customization Options:

- Text Size (can change with both the slider and the buttons added to the player)
- Text Opacity
- Text Color (also changes the color of the added buttons.. because it looks cool) 
- Text Position (Left v Right)

#### Sidenote:

When I first made this for myself there no were available extensions that provided this functionality. Since then, Github user Rioam2 has done some great work with providing his own extension that does the same thing. 
We had the same idea but used different executions so definitely check his out as well and see if that works better for you! 
(Since his is open source as well, I may be able to just contribute my customization options to his project)
